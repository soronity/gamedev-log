Great weekend of game dev! I decided to start up this devlog for me to keep tabs on the progress, setbacks and reflect on what I learn during the process. 
I created a template for reflection I'll use everyday in addition to general reflections.

Started Saturday by downloading vcpkg and setting up the environment in Visual Studio to run the game. It worked after some time.

We decided to go with an Agile approach using a KanBan with Trello. Perhaps doing sprints every weekend for the 3 or so hours I have available on my free weekend days.
We will see how the project progresses without this first to get to grips with what is possible for me to do. 

I started to read about Box2D since it's used heavily in our project. They had a specific warning about not using it for one's first C++ project. Haha, challenge accepted!

I also created fire_projectile and destroy_slime functions to spawn and fire an arrow in the direction the player is facing. 
If it hits a slime, it and the arrow get destroyed. The player moves backwards though as the arrow spawns on the player currently, which needs to be addressed.
